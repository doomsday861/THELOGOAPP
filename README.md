<h1> THELOGOAPP</h1>
I'll probably be getting my hands dirty with Java this time. It will be an attempt to replicate the TURTLE game, we used to play in 5th grade maybe? But yeah, I will be using Java.
<h2> Why?</h2>
  Because it has been sooooooo longgg that I have written anything in Java, and you know, Java is <3, plus I will have something interesting to do, when Graphs and Bits drive me nuts. And probably learn shiz I forgot, thats it bois!
